Create shortcode of countries to pray for with up to date information from the CIA World Factbook and Operation World links.

== Description ==
Create shortcode of countries to pray for with up to date information from the CIA World Factbook and Operation World links.
This plugin retreives demographic data from the CIA World Factbook via https://github.com/factbook/factbook.json. That data is updated when a country's details are displayed in the admin area if older than 7 days old. For performance the shortcode uses current stored data.
This plugin provides outbound links for countries to the Operation World website and Amazon for the Operation World book
